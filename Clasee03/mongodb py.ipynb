Cheer was nice enough to let me drop off my bags earlier than check-in time so that I could go into the city for the day and was not bothered by me coming in and out late or early. She had everything I needed in the room including clean towels, cold water, a fan, books, and anything else I might need. The best part about her apartment was Mason the pup, he's VERY sweet!

Cheer ran back from work to unlock the door for me so I could get my luggage. I highly recommend this place to everybody!'},\n",

But Cheer was very helpful and accepted me as a guest. If you choose to stay with them, you are looking at a cozy bedroom well-stocked with basics like an electric kettle, a tiny fridge, water, tea bags, instant coffee sachets, creamer and sugar. So, there was no need to intrude their kitchen. Once you step out, you are welcomed to a melting pot of cultures. There are many inexpensive but good restaurants. The room was well-lit and comfortable. They really respect your privacy as well. I would definitely recommend you to stay with thffem.'},\n",

       "    'comments': 'My husband, son and I were fortunate enough to have discovered the Henry Norman Hotel for our recent stay in Greenpoint Brooklyn. Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. '},\n",

I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!'},\n",

He was very responsive to our communication and helpful in providing direction once our flight landed.  He even provided us with the written directions in Cantonese in case our taxi driver didn’t speak English (which came in very handy!).\\r\\n\\r\\nRicky had his cousin meet us at a College which was 10 minutes from the airport.  His cousin was very friendly and helpful – he even arrived with a cart to carry our bags to the apartment.   As there are no vehicles that directly access Ricky’s neighbourhood, there was a lovely 5 minute walk on a beautiful path which weaved through the jungle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arrival at Ricky’s building, it was clear that the place was very clean and well kept.  He provided us with some water bottles, offered us dinner, and his 2 friendly cats entertained us while he checked us in.  He proceeded to show us the rooftop terrace which is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view of the mountains.  There is also an area to wash and hang dry your laundry up there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room appeared to be recently renovated.  It was small, but it was very clean and efficiently laid out.  There was good A/C to keep cool as well as a TV with some basic cable for some entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this was a perfect place nearby the airport to spend the night before continuing our travels.  The price was fair, and I would highly recommend staying here. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"},\n",

Ricky was able to pick us up for a small charge, which I would highly recommend since it otherwise would be difficult to find this property if you are not familiar with the area.\\n\\nWe woke up the first day and Ricky and his colleague provided us with maps and directions in both English and Cantonese. Furthermore, they gave us a walking tour around the property as well as highlighted all the main attractions in and around their area. \\n\\nI would also recommend this property to anyone who is interested in going to Hong Kong Disneyland as it has a close proximity to the Metro Station and local bus routes. \\n\\nAll in all, Ricky and his friend were very friendly, professional, and informative. They spoke very clear English and were very helpful in both providing us with extremely personalized customer service. Again, I would highly recommend this property to anyone. '},\n",

Ricky was great about communicating with me from beginning to end. He answered all my questions super fast! Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \\n\\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \\n\\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay. Don't wait...just book with them! \"},\n",

The only very small negative we can say is the noisyness at night on the weekend BUT you can pop to the pharmacy next door and pick up some earplugs and that solves the problem!! Absolutely LOVED the location and decor of the apartment. Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)\"},\n",

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \\nAwful experience all around.\"},\n",

       "    'comments': \"Worst Airbnb experience ever! On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \\nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \\nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE.\"},\n",

До Истикляль можно дойти минут за 6-8. Если пойти вниз от квартиры мимо больницы немецкого посольства, то до трамвая всего минут 15 ходьбы. В доме 6 этажей, лифт имеется. Подъезд закрывается на ключ и в маленькой коморке в подвальчике обязательно кто-то дежурит из людей Османа. Рядом с домом есть супермаркет CARREFOUR, что очень хорошо. Пару раз дергал Османа просьбами - он всегда помогал. В квартире 2 кондиционера ,  посуда, вайфай, тв, чайник и тд. рекомендую!'},\n",

It is located in calm small street, but not far from Istacle street and the square, where airport shuttle buses are arriving. There is also supermarket just around the corner. So very convenient! We had everything we needed in the apartment, but don't expect 5star hotel :) It is cosy home atmosphere. There are some problem in shower as water is passing by and getting on floor, but otherwise all is good :) Thank's for Osman and his team! Osman was very responsive, when I had some doubts due to not calm situation in Taksim square. Luckily all was good :) I can for sure recommend Osman and his apartments as home out of home :) \"},\n",

I will be returning in the future and could not imagine a better place to stay. The area of the apartment was perfect. A stone throw away from the main street and taxsim square and a 5 minute walk to kabatas. I couldn't think of a better place to stay if your a family or a young group like we were.

There was a problem with the plumbing in the bathroom, some leaking around the base of the toilet - which made the small bathroom quite wet. Osman offered to have it fixed while we were there to be fair, but we didn't want a tradesman through during our stay. It will hopefully be repaired when you stay here.

Nighttime can be quite noisy because of cheering football fans or people drinking in the streets in weekends. Walking distance to Taksim square, where you have all public transport. If you are in good shape, it's nice to explore the neighborhood by foot.\"},\n",

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\\n\\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \\n\\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \\n\\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \\n\\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \\n\\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \\n\\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. \"},\n",

Tem tudo o que é preciso para uma boa estadia, como utensílios de cozinha e roupas de cama e banho! Os banheiros estavam extremamente limpos, a recepção e a comunicação foi ótima! Além disso, é preciso destacar a localização, bem próxima às praias de Copacabana e Ipanema, e de estar no mesmo quarteirão de lanchonete, padaria, restaurante, supermercado, farmácia e bancos! Super indico e com certeza voltaria a me hospedar lá.'},\n",

The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \\r\\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\\r\\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building. If we are able to visit Porto again, we would definitely stay in this charming apartment again! Thank you, Fabio!\"},\n",

The apartment is just as described and just like it is on the photos:clean, functional, pretty and very well-located. It faces the street but it's not loud at night.

He was waiting for us when we arrived, and then he told us everything important about the city, gave us information about the sights, how to reach them and so on. So he told us for example that we didn´t have to use public transportation, and that is absolutely true, because the apartment is so good located, that you can reach every important point by walk. But if you have to use the underground it is close to the flat, so get to the airport or the beach isn´t a problem. The flat is extremely clean, and furnished very modern, so it was a great feeling to stay here. Especially for those of you who like to party with the domestic, there are a lot of bars in the neighbourhood, which are full at night, so you can enjoy a walk at night there. I would always choose this apartment again and would recommend it to everyone. Thank you Fabio.'},\n",

A localização dele é a melhor: a rua é uma das mais legais, com lojas vintage, locais para refeições, bares e pubs. Fica à uma distância agradável da Ribeira para se deslocar a pé, e muito próximo das principais ruas. Fizemos tudo caminhando: Sé, Cais, Livraria Lello, Galeria de Paris (noite), Rua de Santa Catarina, e estávamos cercados de opções de bares, hamburguerias, restaurantes, locais para o pequeno almoço. É próximo as estações de metro também. O espaço está muito bem decorado e utilizado, é espaçoso, e bem iluminado. Possui uma cozinha equipada para quem desejar, ótimas roupas de cama, duas sacadinhas muito agradáveis. Foi uma ótima experiência e quando voltarmos ao Porto, este espaço será nossa primeira opção.

O apartamento tem realmente uma ótima localização (mesmo!) e espaço suficiente e agradável para um casal. Tudo estava muito limpo e cheiroso, a cozinha bem equipada, cama confortável e a sacada é um adicional agradável. Há opções de café, pubs e bares na própria rua do apartamento. Mais uma vez, tivemos a certeza que esse é um sítio para quem pretende desfrutar a cidade em um local próximo de todos os pontos turísticos a uma distância tranquila a pé, próximo a comércio, opções para refeições, perto de estações de metro e transportes públicos.

       "    'comments': 'Fábio was a super host. He met us at the apartment and gave us a tour, instructions for check-out, etc. He offered lots of ideas for things to see and do in Porto. He also wrote down a list of restaurants that he liked. He told us to get in touch with him any time if we had more questions. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, stove, etc. there was even salt, pepper and oil. Much appreciated as my husband and I cooked breakfast every morning. We LOVED the location. We walked everywhere from the apartment. Minutes from the Sao Bento(?) train station and many other attractions. There was a supermarket and laundromat within a few blocks as well as a variety of different cafes and restaurants. The apartment has been completely and tastefully updated and is completely secure.  We had a wonderful five days in Fábio’s apartment and would stay there again if back in Porto. '},\n",

Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on.

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job.

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}]},\n",

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\\r\\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great.'},\n",

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"},\n",

I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom!

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. \"},\n",

We had everything we needed and the extra beds in each room saved me headache and money - very efficient!

My kids played in the sand the whole time! we went swimming when we can, the tide was higher in the afternoon. There was some much room for everyone to spread out and relax! There were local supermarket close by too, so convenient!! Thank you again Noah!'},\n",

       "    'comments': '호스트인 Mr. Noah는 상당히 친절하고 따뜻한 사람이었습니다. 가족이나 친구들끼리 온전한 쉼을 얻고자 한다면 이 집은 최상입니다. 걸어서 5분거리에 Polynasian Culural Center가 있고 바로 집앞에는 아름다운 태평양이 펼쳐져 있습니다. 또한 15분 북쪽으로 가면 Shrimp Food Truck이 있고 10분거리에 9홀 골프장이 위치해 있습니다. 비록 전동카트가 없어 걸어야 하지만 바닷가를 배경으로 골프를 치는 환상적인 경험을 하실 수 있습니다. 가격또한 한사람당 골프클럽세트까지 $32.50으로 상당히 저렴합니다. 하지만 한인마켓에서 장을 보거나 Costco 또는 쇼핑을 하기 원하신다면 하루 날을 잡아야 할 것입니다. 이유는 그곳들까지 대략 1시간남짓 걸리기 때문입니다. 그래서 며칠간 도시와 떨어져 쉼을 갖기 원하신다면 정말 좋은곳입니다. 현대적인 도시의 삶에서 벗어나 아름다운 노아의 집에서 한번 머물러 보시길 추천합니다.'},\n",

Being winter we missed out on beach access as the tide was in, but it didn't stop us taking advantage of the private water access and sitting out on the steps. There were food trucks and cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as grocery stores within a short driving distance. The rustic feel of Laie is so much more pleasant than the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. \"},\n",

We enjoyed breathtaking sunrises from the master bedroom and outdoor sunbathing pad almost every day. We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend staying at Noah's beach house, and hope to find another reason to stay again in the future. Thank you Noah for making our weekend so memorable.\"},\n",

The water right in front of the house is the perfect spot for snorkeling and we saw lots of fish and a seal that came right by us a few times! When the tide is out the water is very calm. Around the corner is Pounders beach which has some decent waves for boogie boarding. It is a 5 minute walk to the Polynesian Cultural Center and about an hour from Honolulu. If you want a more slow paced vacation away from crowds then this is the perfect spot. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. Our whole group loved it.'},\n",

The host was extremely easy to work with and had pre-stocked the house with pots/pans, paper towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc.\\n\\nThe best part about this house was the location, being right on the coast.  There is a nice back patio, and another concrete slab by the water with steps leading down to the beach.

       "    'comments': \"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Bobby's bungalow, so much so that I extended my stay an additional week!  The cottage is very comfortable and equipped with everything you need.   The space is open and roomy, even more so than the listing pics suggest.   As with many Hawaiian dwellings, there are lots of windows, and the cottage offers an open air, indoor/outdoor style of living.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso of note: the bed is new and king-sized, and is super comfortable-- one of the best I've slept on lately.  Its wonderfully supportive and guarantees a great night's sleep.  Internet access and speeds were very good, something of a priority for me.   Washer and drier out the back door was also a plus.   Out the front door is a picnic table  (put to good use everyday),  and a shady sitting area under a blooming Hong Kong Orchid tree-- delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottage basically sits on its own parcel, with your own private driveway, and so it offers good privacy.   The location is somewhat off the beaten path, which I found desirable, as areas of the North Shore can get busy at times.  Still, there's easy access to area beaches, shopping in Haleiwa, the weekend farmer's market's, etc.   And then there's literally miles of amazing beaches to explore from the cottage to Ka'ena Point.   \\r\\n\\r\\nSaving the best for last: Bobby and Mike are excellent hosts and genuinely lovely people-- the aloha spirit here is awesome.  Both are very friendly and  accommodating,  generously sharing weekend BBQ dishes (delicious!) and providing a fresh pineapple to welcome their guest.   I had a great time at the Banyan Bungalow-- only wish I could have stayed longer.  Highly recommended!\"},\n",

Bobby was quick to respond to my last minute inquiry (next day booking), and they had a nice welcome pack for me. I also loved that the kitchen was well stocked with a blender and juicer. I booked this over another place because of a review that the king size bed is comfortable - and it definitely was! There's a beach close by, and I was often the only one on it (or only with a few others), which is incredible to find for the busy island. I'd come back for sure. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is great, Haleiwa is close by (10min drive) with lots of great restaurants (including a couple great organic, locally sourced ones), smoothie bars, grocery store and surf lessons.\"},\n",

The cottage was exactly as in the pictures and Bobby had left some local treats including freshly laid eggs from her own hens for me! The area is so safe you don't need to shut the doors and it is quiet as anything-except for the wild roosters, but these are everywhere in Hawaii and you get used to them very quickly.  The beach is a short walk away, and Bobby loaned me a beach cruiser bicycle so I could ride into the North Shore town of Haleiwa which was on bike paths all the way.  The cottage also has a great outdoor shower which is perfect for ending a trip to the beach.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaialua is the real Hawaii, it is quiet and away from most of the touristy stuff and it was very nice not to be in Wakiki!  But still only a short drive to historic Haleiwa which has restaurants and shops.  I cooked for myself most evenings in the cottage which was easy enough on the hot plate and the cottage was very peaceful in the evening, with fantastic starts to be watched from the garden after dark.   Bobby also brought me fresh pineapple from the plantation and the mangos at this time of year were so delicious- another fantastic touch!\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd really recommend staying with Bobby if you are looking for a peaceful, North Shore, real Hawaii stay.  It was absolutely fantastic-and the bed is massive and super comfortable!  Great value and really super!   Bobby is a great host, she was really welcoming and always contactable but left me to my privacy too.  She went out of her way to help me get some mail I was expecting and had great recommendations about the area. \"},\n",

Located on the beautiful North Shore, this rental is peaceful and perfectly situated to allow you to have an amazing time exploring the island. Very close to Ka'ena Point, where we saw wild whales migrating off the coast, and to the lovely surf town of Hale'iwa. There's a secluded beach in close walking distance, and we also used our rental car to explore some of the incredible beaches within a short drive, like Waimea Bay. The space itself was clean and well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed! Bobby was very easy to communicate with and we felt so well taken care of, right down to the arrival treats that were left for us (very appreciated after a long flight!). I'll echo what some others have mentioned here, which is to bring earplugs for nighttime sleeping, as there are junglefowl all over the island (wild chickens!) and the roosters do like to announce their presence at all hours - you'll hear this everywhere you go. I highly recommend this Airbnb rental! It was perfect for our trip and we couldn't be happier.\"},\n",

The cottage was so peaceful and relaxing. I was so happy with how private the space was. Just like the ad described, it has its own driveway and completely private space, the adjacent houses were even separated by a fence.  The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with games, towels, snacks, and other supplies. I wish we didn't have to run around so much that weekend so that we could have enjoyed the cottage more. We didn't even get to cut open the fresh pineapple that Bobby left for us! Although I did enjoy the crackers and peanut butter :) \\n\\nThis is the perfect weekend getaway for locals, or vacation spot for out of towners looking for a peaceful getaway. If you want to be be closer to the hustle and bustle, then I would look for a place closer to Haleiwa or Sunset. It is pretty quiet here (minus the roosters in the am), and other than the beach, it is not really walking distance to much. Which we loved actually :) Also, I really appreciated that Bobby was readily available to help with directions and check-in details, but more importantly that she gave us privacy and space once we checked in. \\n\\nIf I ever need to come back up the North Shore for a relaxing weekend, I would certainly book again! Highly recommended!\"},\n",

The bungalow is clean, open, and roomy, with a giant, comfortable California King size bed in the middle and a kitchen housing all the essentials (glasses, plates, silverware, coffee maker, ice trays, etc.). \\n\\nThere is also a television and WiFi available, which we used to connect to Spotify for some music. But oh, the sounds, the sounds, the sounds!\\n\\nI actually chose this reservation because of the reviews which described the sounds of the North Shore. I love chickens and birds and grew up with their gentle AM serenades, therefore this place was perfect. The roosters sang to impress while other birds crooned and cackled, creating a beautiful medley of island sounds that makes this place unique.\\n\\nThere is a giant yard and private gate on the outside of the bungalow, and an outdoor shower which was perfect for hosing off all the sand from the luscious beach. \\n\\nAnd the beach, what a beach it was! Upon arrival Bobby and her partner greeted us with a fresh pineapple and gave us directions to the ocean and encouraged us to use their cruiser bicycles. The beach is about a ten-minute walk or a three-minute bike ride -- either journey is pleasant, with the bike ride maybe being better because it gets you there faster.\\n\\nPicture all the noise and umbrellas and kayaks and floaties of Waikiki Beach, and all the surfers and gatherers of those at say, Banzai Pipeline, and then picture the exact opposite. The beach in this spot was quiet, with gentle, clean waves and at most I saw a maximum of about eight other people who were either snorkeling or just hanging out with dogs.\\n\\nAt one point, after relaxing on the beach for so long, my partner and I took a nap and were awakened by a friendly pooch named Tucker, who was all smiles as we gave him pets and ear scratches (sorry if that was TMI, we are dog people after all).\\n\\nI could yam on and on about this place, but I think I've done all the yamming I could possible yam.\\n\\nI give this place ten stars out of five, and the hosts also ten stars out of five.\\n\\nDid I mention we really enjoyed our stay?\"},\n",

Also nice to have access to a washer and dryer. It was my first visit to the North Shore and this was a great introduction.  The location is somewhat in the country and there are birds and chickens so you should bring your ear plugs, but I slept soundly (and the host provided ear plugs though I brought my own).  And while it is well equipped with a number of fans and plenty of windows to catch the breeze, there is no air condition, and it does get warm inside by the afternoon if that bothers you.'},\n",

The place is very well decorated, a nice large bed and enough room to really make you feel at home. Very private setting, including private access and parking.\\nThe host was very accomodating and communication was nearly immediate. In fact, on our last morning I texted to let her know we'd be going for a quick snorkle at Wiamea Bay (15 min drive) and back by 9:30 to check out at 10. She was gracious enough to allow for a later checkout which turned out to be marvelous. \\nYou must have a car to stay here. No public transportation available and Uber would be potentially challenging.\\nThe beach at the end of the street (down the street, take a right for a short distance) was fantastic for a semi-private location with good swimming. The water is fairly shallow with ok snorkeling. Bikes had flat tires so we drove. Not a huge deal. \\nThe Roosters - I have to say that as charming as the chickens and chicks are that roam the North Shore (we have some at home), the roosters are quite challenging in the mornings, and for certain guests, this could be a deal breaker for this particular location. We did have one night that a couple in the neighborhood tested their vocal cords at 3:30 am for a few minutes. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wanted to strangle a few of them, but we were up and going each morning anyway so this wasn't a deal breaker for us. \\nWe loved this location and would stay again.\"},\n",

It was pretty hot while we were there, but the fans helped us sleep comfortably for the most part.  The house was clean and stocked with beach towels, as well as other amenities.  The beach is just steps away from the house, and we rode our bikes there to enjoy an almost private beach.   Bobby was fast at communicating and was willing to help with whatever we needed. I highly recommend Bobby's place for anyone wanting a quiet, Hawaiian country experience.\"},\n",

They offered so many amenities with their rental (bicycles (3 total), there were snack and beverages in the refrigerator, extra towels, and they had provided a twin mattress for my daughter (7 years old)). \\n\\nThey were so very welcoming and accommodating from check in to check out. This location was perfect for a wedding we had out in Waialua over the weekend, it was no more than a 5 minute drive as opposed to an hour and a half long drive back home. \\n\\nI'm so very thankful for their hospitality and their generosity during our stay!!! If you're looking for a quaint, private, isolated home away from home, this place is definitely worth your stay!\"},\n",

There is a separate, gated driveway to the bungalow with a ton of outdoor space and lawn furniture you can hang out in.   I wasn't expecting how big the studio really is.  There are thoughtful decorations that make you believe someone has put a lot of time and thought into this place.  \\nThe beach is beautiful and within about a 5 minute walk (10 if you stroll and take photos of all the flowers along the way.)  My second day, I took one of the 3 bikes provided and rode the way to Hale'iwa.  Just go out the driveway, turn left and take a right at the end of the street.  Beach access is along the way and a bike path eventually opens up and it's a lovely drive with mountains on one side and beach on the other. \\nI didn't get to meet the hosts since I got in rather late, but check in instructions were sent to me and really easy to follow.   I loved everything about this place and should I find myself on Oahu again, I'll definitely be back to this bungalow.\"},\n",

Andreia trabaja en la cafetería que hay debajo por lo que es fácil encontrarla si hay cualquier problema. La calle en la que está el apartamento es peatonal con tiendas y cafeterias en pleno centro pero lo bueno es que la habitación da a una zona interior por lo que no se oye ningún ruido.  Lo recomendamos sin ninguna duda!'},\n",

Das Apartment liegt wie auf den Fotos erkennbar zur hinteren Seite, sodass wir von dem munteren Leben auf der wirklich schönen Rua das Flores innerhalb der Wohnung nichts mitbekommen haben. Andreia führte uns bei der Begrüßung nach oben und zeigte uns die Räumlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck bestätigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: Für einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages außerhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstraße überhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem nötigsten an Verpflegung für unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Darüber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. Sämtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fußmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento fährt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise kümmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gepäck nach dem Checkout sicher für ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten. Ich kann dieses Apartment nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen!'},\n",

A signaler juste que la cabine de douche n'est pas très grande, donc pour les fortes corpulences c'est un peu juste.\\r\\nNous avons pu découvrir la ville de Porto et avons été agréablement surpris par sa grandeur, par les multiples choses à faire ou à découvrir, des bons petits restaurants à apprécier. D'autant que la vie est moins chère qu'en France. Andreia est disponible et agréable. Nous pensons revenir très bientôt dans le même appartement.\"},\n",

I wish we could've stayed longer and will definitely return if need be... Thanks so much, Ladies!! \"},\n",

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at. \"},\n",

Althought there was a slight effort of communication between us and Anette, I didn't really feel that welcomed like with our previous hosts, which might have made me look little bit uneasy. There was also very big traffic around the single bathroom which took away little bit of our privacy. In any case the apartament title is not misleading.

The apartment was very clean and you get your own set of keys to go in and out as you wish. Overall great affordable place to stay and super friendly hosts. Would stay again.'},\n",

The area is safe, once I came back at 4 a.m. and I had no problems. Close to the JFK airport and La Guardia airport, taxi to the JFK airport is about 20$.It takes 30-40 min to get to Manhattan, which is not bad for such a big city. I spent in this apartment about 10 days and I was always happy to come back after a long day. Highly recommend!'},\n",

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!\"},\n",

The location is within walking distance from the Kew Gardens E/J Subway, and close to stores and fast food.  It is also right next to a major highway in Queens, which makes for easy road access.  The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.  The room is located in a third-floor apartment, and you need to use stairs to get there.  Lane is a fantastic host.  She is very responsive on email and helpful.  In all, I had a good experience because of the location and Lane's hospitality.\"},\n",

The reason I came back is because besides marvelous view and the setup the place has this amazing energy which is especially rejuvenating after a stressful work period back in NYC. Wherever you are in the apartment your eyes are almost constantly facing the green if the trees, water and the Christo statue in the background which is very relaxing. \\n\\nDuring my starving was around 35C in Rio so I spend a good time in the pool which is very deep, clean and enjoyable. Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \\n\\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. \\n\\nI will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. '},\n",

Conveniently located in Ipanema, the apartment is walking distance to grocery stores, world class restaurants, and beautiful beaches. Cesar was an incredibly kind host. He left us snacks on arrival and shared with us a cake upon departure. A truly kind spirit. The hardest part was leaving. Would love to return one day. Saudades!\"},\n",

Het ligt iets verder weg van het centrum maar door het metrostation vlakbij toch heel gemakkelijk bereikbaar. De kamers waren heel erg schoon, net als de badkamers, en ook de keuken was voldoende voorzien. En vooral Anabela, de dame die je ontvangt, is gewoonweg fantastisch. Ze heeft ons van heel veel leuke tips voorzien, ook dingen om te doen met onze kinderen, en ze was altijd bereikbaar voor vragen ed. Dit appartement is zeker een aanrader!'},\n",

Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing.

It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action.\"},\n",

They had thought of everything, and we really appreciated the homely touches. The bed is very comfy, there is plenty of wardrobe space, and a comfy couch when a night in is in order. Despite the location right near Hyde Park, it is very quiet and we were not bothered by any noise during our stay. Desireé and Julian were lovely hosts and we appreciated the clear directions and easy check-in and check-out. We would love to stay here again when we’re in Sydney again!'},\n",

Luckily, I have more space. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \\r\\n\\r\\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"},\n",

Laura made me feel home since day one. Living with her made my days happier and funnier, she's caring, full of energy, curious and interesting. She's very open minded and used to meeting different people all the time. There's no way you could be bored having her around. \\nIf you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good adviser, she knows her city by heart. If you're staying longer like I did, the only risk is that you might have a heavy heart when it will be time to leave. \\n\"},\n",

The apartment is in a safe neighbourhood, located within a couple of minutes walking distance of the bustling Blvd St-Laurent. There are so many great restaurants, cafés and shops nearby (including a large supermarket a few minutes away) you are spoiled for choice.

Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that’s what you’re into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It’s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn’t make my stay any less incredible. The price is right and I cannot recommend this place enough! '},\n",

The Metro is only a 10 Minute walk away and lots of bus stops are nearby. If you like, you can easily walk to the city center or visit sights like the Mont-Royal. Laura is a very great host: super friendly and caring. She made it really easy for me to settle in Montreal and very fast it felt a bit like home :) The room is very nice and bigger than I have expected! The decoration of her place is very lovely as well! I cannot recommend this place enough!'},\n",

Lovely place, very comfortable, felt like home, extremely central and close to the metro, restaurants and shops.   From the beginning the communication with Maria was very easy despite that we were both in different countries and she was very accommodating and nice.  I would highly recommend Maria's place and hope to stay there on one of my next visits to HK.\"},\n",

With the caveat that many HK apartments are relatively small, Maria’s place was certainly big enough for a couple.  Two key things:  the bathroom had ample hot/cold water and the bed was super comfortable.  We didn’t cook anything, but the kitchen was well-stocked and there’s a small grocery store just next to the apartment. The location is great – two blocks from a metro station, near the trolley / bus lines, right below Man Mo Temple, and about a 15-20 minute walk to Central, Soho, and the piers.  There’s a great dim sum place about a block north and wonderful older streets, with traditional shops selling ginseng and dried seafood are all nearby.  Maria was very responsive before arrival and during our stay.  Overall highly recommended!'},\n",

Transport is close by, restaurants are in abundant supply, and the locals are usually helpful and happy if you are spending money.  The antique markets are a short walk away and there are some fantastic tea rooms just around the corner.  Loved the area and the apartment.

       "    'comments': 'This apt could not have a better location — it’s about a 15 min walk from Central and right in the heart of Sheung wan, which is itself a lovely neighborhood. There are tons of cute cafes, restaurants, and shops a stone throw’s away. Be aware though that Sheung wan is extremely hilly, with lots of stairs. The MTR station is very close — a straight walk down Hilier st, which is right in front of the apt. No hills or stairs on this walk! I should also say that cabs are very easy to find in front of the apt, and quite cheap and reliable. Cabbies often don’t speak English but we showed our destination on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, and this worked great every time. \\n\\nThe apt itself was small by our Wisconsin standards but probably quite large by HK standards. It was clean and cozy and perfectly fine. It was surprisingly quiet for being in such a bustling neighborhood. The bathroom and kitchen were small (but we didn’t need to cook or even shop for groceries considering all the amazing food options nearby) and there was little storage for our stuff. But for two people it was great and we had such a wonderful time there. Nothing but lovely memories. \\n\\nMaria missed our initial Airbnb request because she was traveling, but once we got a hold of her she was super responsive and helpful. \\n\\nWe had such a happy stay in HK. Thank you Maria for providing a great home base.'},\n",

I talk on the phone a lot and am a morning gym person.\\n\\nI grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years.

From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home.

It\\'s very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It\\'s in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner\\'s unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \\r\\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn\\'t feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn\\'t emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\\r\\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\\r\\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you\\'re not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don\\'t mind the price. '},\n",
